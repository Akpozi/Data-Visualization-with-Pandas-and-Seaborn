Brief introduction to Data Visualization with Pandas and Seaborn: code examples


Data Visualization is the presentation of data in pictorial format. This is very important and useful for Data Analysis, primarily because the data-centric Python packages provide a fantastic ecosystem that support this. It is helpful in understanding the data, however, complex it may be.

A huge amount of data can be summarized and presented in a simple and easy-to-understand format that helps communicate information clearly and effectively.

Examples of such Python packages are Pandas and Seaborn. They are packages that are used to make importing and analyzing data much easier.
